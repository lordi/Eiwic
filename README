Quick compilation guide
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        - Ungzip & untar the eiwic-1.1.x.tar.gz file

        - Run: ./configure

        - Run: make (use gmake on *BSD)

        - Edit 'sample.conf' to fit your needs and save it as 'bot.conf'

        - Optional: Run "./eiwic bot.conf -l - -v 10" to probe if the bot is
          running correctly with your bot.conf. If it doesn't give you errors
          or warnings and joins the channels you set, your configuration is
          alright and you can kill the bot again through SIGINT (Ctrl-C).

        - To run the bot in the background finally, you may launch it with
          "./eiwic bot.conf -d" or, additionally, with "-l eiwic.log -v X" if
          you want a logfile (X is the verbosity level, set it to 10 for a
          verbose debug logfile, or to 2 for a normal (smaller) logfile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Send bugs to lordi@styleliga.org with a description and, if necessary, the part
of the logfile.

Thanks go out to alpha_5 for running Eiwic on his server so many bugs have been
found, to Youk for making it run on OpenBSD and to Elaminato for testing Eiwic
with Cygwin :)


Changelog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.4 - mar 28th 2010
        * patch by Florian Scholz: nickserv module & dict enhancements

        * Added RSS newsfeed module (rssfeed.c) (libraptor required)
        * You can now create a modules/*.buildflags file where additional
          flags for the specific module can be written down
        * You can now create a modules/*.skip file to skip a module during
          compilation
        * -t flag can now take multiple trigger lines, seperated by semicolon
        * output_tostring() to get the output destination (channel, query, ...)

1.1.2 - ....

1.1.1 - oct 27th 2004
        * fixed a bug with output routing
        * added more functions to admin.so

        * added experimental !getnick module - dont use it ;)
        * added a crash/debug module

1.1.0 - oct 15th 2004
        * added output routing:
          every trigger, ep_main, ep_help function doesn't have to
          send its output now directly to the server. it just sends
          its output to an OUTPUT object, which will then be routed
          to a channel, and then to the server, for example
        * changed module API because of the output routing
        * in the msvc/ directory is now a MSVC studio workspace (not
          for compiling, just editing)
        * thrown out some modules... fixed all other modules to match the 
          new module API
        * introduced ep_help callback for the modules
        * changed !help trigger from the info module. it can now be used
          to read what the ep_help trigger returns from every module.
        * triggers can now be used in private /msgs to the bot
        * triggers can now be tested with the -t cmdline parameter
